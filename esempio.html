    <h1>I primi esempi</h1>
        <p>Blue Moon, You saw me standing alone<br>
            Whitout a dream in my heart<br>
            Without a love of my own<br><br>
            
            Blue Moon, You knew just what I was there for<br>
            You heard me saying a prayer for<br>
            Someone I could really care for<br><br>
            
            Then suddenly they’ll appear before me<br>
            The only one my arms could ever hold<br>
            I heard someone whisper “Please adore me”<br>
            And when I looked my moon had turned to gold.<br><br>
            
            Blue Moon, now I’m no longer alone<br>
            I have a dream in my heart<br>
            I have a love of my own</p>

    <h5>When you walk through a storm
        Hold your head up high
        And don’t be afraid of the dark
        At the end of a storm
        There’s a golden sky
        And the sweet silver song of a lark
        Walk on through the wind
        Walk on through the rain
        Though your dreams be tossed and blown
        Walk on, walk on
        With hope in your heart
        And you’ll never walk alone
        You’ll never walk alone
        Walk on, walk on
        With hope in your heart
        And you’ll never walk alone
        You’ll never walk alone</h5>
